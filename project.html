A wind farm is a renewable energy project that harnesses the power of wind to generate electricity. The project involves the installation of multiple wind turbines, which are strategically placed in areas with high wind speeds, such as coastal regions or open plains. The turbines are connected to a central power grid, which distributes the generated electricity to homes and businesses. The goal of a wind farm project is to reduce dependence on non-renewable sources of energy, such as coal or gas, and to lower greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, wind energy is cost-effective and has a low environmental impact, making it an attractive option for sustainable energy production.
